# Mobile export work log

## Window and goal

Start: 2026-10-13 09:45 UTC. End: 2026-10-14 01:45 UTC.
Reduce the experimental planet export for mobile browsers. Aim well below
100 MB for both data files. Record file size, browser memory, load time, and
changes to the map. Keep the fitted plans and full export as references.
Do not change production, UK, or Germany datasets. Keep H3-MON stopped except
for isolated, headless checks that do not start its normal service.

## 09:45 UTC: inspect the consumer and plan measurements

The full export has 120,753,287 rows and uses 8.24 GB. It keeps 99.999% of
each source cell's transport mass. This is a research export, not a suitable
browser dataset. The current browser loads the entire file and builds row
indexes, so file compression alone will not fix its memory use.

The browser uses target-normalized `weight_mean` for aggregation. It also
uses source-to-target support for navigation. Keep both source and target
coverage, the original labels, and source population totals. Measure errors
in target population, geographic means, source means, and conditional weights.

Compare these approaches before choosing a default:

1. Cull by source weight, with explicit source and target coverage guards.
2. Cull by population contribution to each target, with a source anchor.
3. Use narrower numeric columns where their error is negligible.
4. If necessary, adjust the sparse weights to reduce marginal or moment error.

Do not confuse an approximate browser export with the full fitted transport.
Keep the full-plan mass checks unchanged. Test the Arrow files with the actual
JavaScript dependencies before publication. Compression must not require an
unsupported Arrow codec or conceal excessive decoded memory.

Documentation checked: Arrow.jl write API, loaders.gl Arrow reading guide,
and the Arrow JavaScript compression issue. The installed browser uses
Apache Arrow 19.0.1 through loaders.gl. Its actual decoder is the final check.
